# FORGEX4 // PROJECT ARES-X (Omni-Sentinel)
> **Strategic Intelligence Architect: Kian Mansouri Jamshidi**

## 🌐 Vision: The Refereed Truth Engine
Project ARES-X is a high-assurance strategic intelligence platform developed by **Forgex4**. It is built on the philosophy of **Asymmetric Observation**: while an adversary can hide their assets, they cannot hide the **Friction** those assets create or the **Negative Space** they leave behind in civilian data streams.

ARES-X democratizes high-level ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) by converting "The Asymmetry of Leakage" into actionable, predictive military intelligence.

## 🏗 The Sentinel Kernel (Architecture)
Built for high-assurance, safety-critical execution using a bifurcated code pipeline:

- **The Vacuum (Ingestion):** Multi-tier OSINT pipeline written in **Rust** (Tokio/Reqwest) for high-concurrency ingestion of ADS-B, AIS, FIRMS, and Sentinel-2 data.
- **The Nexus (Storage):** Sub-second SQL processing for 1M+ active points using **DuckDB + Spatial Extension**.
- **The Oracle (Decision Logic):** High-reliability decision engine built in **SPARK/Ada**. Formally verified to be free of overflows, runtime errors, and logic dead-ends.
- **The Vault (Relational):** **Neo4j** mapping of Command and Control (C2) hierarchies and logistical inter-dependencies.
- **The Shield (Security):** **AES-256-XTS** at-rest encryption with a hardware-triggered **Sovereign Kill-Switch**.

## 🛡 Performance & Assurance Mandate
*   **Formal Verification:** 100% of the Oracle’s logic gates are verified via `Kani` and `Prusti`.
*   **Zero-Compute Mandate:** Fully operational on a single localized laptop with $0 in external API/Server costs.
*   **Negative Space Detection:** 3-sigma deviation monitoring to identify "The Silence"—the predator’s signature.

## 🚀 Roadmap
- **Phase 0:** The Sovereign Forge (Environment & Toolchain) - **CURRENT**
- **Phase I:** The Secure Nexus (Storage & Encryption)
- **Phase II:** The Vacuum (OSINT Ingestion)
- **Phase III:** The Vault & Doctrine (ORBAT & Heuristics)
- **Phase IV:** The Oracle (Formal Decision Logic)
- **Phase V:** The War Room & Shield (UI & Kill-Switch)
